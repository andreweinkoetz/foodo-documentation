\section{Problem statement}
When we were collecting opinions and practices regarding eating habits in our circle of friends and acquaintances, as well as online forums, we often came across similar statements. A surprising majority of the respondents were quite aware about their eating behavior. Moreover, most of them had a rough understanding what constitutes an unhealthy diet and were already trying to avoid fast food. Therefore, we decided to target this particular group of people, which are motivated to improve their nutrition. By cooking at home, instead of eating out or ordering food, they already took the first step towards a healthier lifestyle.
But even then it’s important what ends up on the plate. At that point, there is often an obstacle, hindering those people to further improve their diet, leading us to their  pains.

\subsection{Pains}
The wide variety of contradicting opinions in the complex subject of nutrition can have a discouraging effect. Gathering new recipes is also quite time consuming. This inconvenience and personal habits lets the potential users stick to the same 5-7 dishes they know.

\subsection{Gains}
Our persona would like to live a healthier lifestyle but it shouldn’t feel like a sacrifice. Suggested alternatives and changes should feel equally good at not inferior. It wishes for convenience instead of the usual handiwork commonly going into keeping track of one's diet. Additionally, there is a need for clear, trustworthy guidelines rooted in scientific research.

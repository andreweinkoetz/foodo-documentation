\chapter{Evaluation}
We conducted two big evaluation rounds. The first one targeted the first prototype and the second one the final prototype. The interviews were conducted either in a personal talk or via a messenger. Due to our setup, in which the most current version of Foodo is deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and accessible for the public, we just handed the link to our webapp to the participants and they could explore Foodo on their own with their own device. That way, we could also test how good Foodo perform on different devices with different browser which strengthens our cross-platform and multi-device approach. The two big evaluation rounds each took up to two to three weeks. This enabled us to incorporate the first gathered feedbacks and to test the new changes within the same evaluation round. This was only feasible because we developed Foodo with a focus on agile development and relied on continuous integration and continous delivery so that even small change get delivered and deployed to the production system as soon as possible. 

Overall, nine (\textbf{ZAHL NICHT FINAL}) participants (seven in the first round and two (\textbf{ZAHL NICHT FINAL}) in the second round) tested Foodo and provided us feedback. They liked Foodo a lot and most of them would use Foodo, when it is market-ready. Specifically, they praised Foodo's clean design, its corss-platform multi-device approach, the Alexa integration, and the idea of getting recommendations for substitutions which improve the healthiness of recipes. Their feedback or suggestions for improvement can be categorized in three areas, namely functional, visual and error feedback, and it is condensed into the following paragraphs.

\section{Functional Feedback}

\smallheadline{Implemented Feedback}

substitution decision is final -> editing needed

difficulty of recipes

Recipe categories with nice overview page -> Kachel

explainatory page about what Foodo is and how it works

list of favorite recipes

statistics on achievements through using Foodo

selecting specific dislikes (some people eat all kinds of meat except porc meat)

\smallheadline{Not Yet Implemented Feedback} 

adding more allergies (nuts) 

adding more lifestyles (kito)

more recipe categories (fast, cheap, feast)

rate recipes with stars

extension with community functions like commenting on recipes and substitutes or posting what you have eaten or substituted

portion calculator for nutrition values and amounts of ingredients

insert own recipes (only implemented in the admin panel)

recommend recipes to user based on the ones he liked / based on clocktime

recommend fitting desert and starter

say reason for substitution (alllergy, dislike, unhealthy, ...)

offer challenges for nudging

offer grocery list

save recipes

suggest crazy substitutions which you wouldnt expect to work e.g. from normal latte to  Red Beet Latte

offer timer for support during cooking

Kosten ausrechnen, wie viel es ungefähr kostet für z.B. 2 Personen???
    
\section{Visual Feedback}

\smallheadline{Implemented Feedback}

not every part is internationalized

units of ingredients are inconsistent (ml is abbbreviated but gramm not)

loading of picture takes long????

put more visiual emphasis on NutriScore

diagrams offer great overview

\smallheadline{Not Yet Implemented Feedback} 

use common units like pinch of salt instead of 0.02 gr
        
        colors should consider red-green color blindness

\section{Error Feedback}

\smallheadline{Implemented Feedback}

cannot select none in the allergies section

errors recognised by the participants due to mocked algorithm (some tested with mocked algo) e.g. although vegan -> suggestions include meat

wrong alignment on some devices eg substitute button moved out of the screen

\smallheadline{Not Yet Implemented Feedback} 

routing issues not getting to the recipe if you are viewing a recipe click on about and then on home you dont get to the recipe you were looking at

routing issues; change password, log out, log in, -> you are still on change pw page

on some smartphones the keyboard is overlaying central parts of the selection e.g. when selecting a dish

on some smartphones is the nutrition value table wrongly displayed (one word is t big -> destroys alignment)

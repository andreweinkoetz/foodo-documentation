\section{Foodo Software System}
\subsection*{Overview}
The Foodo software system is a distributed web based application that follows state-of-the-art architecture techniques. In the following, the architecture of the Foodo application will be described in a top-down manner.
 
The software systems consists of six different components that have been organised in four different code repositories. Those six components are:
\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item React web application (frontend)
	\item HTTP server with REST API (backend)
	\item Functional substitution algorithm (algorithm)
	\item Lambda function for Alexa intents (lambda function)
	\item Alexa skill on the Alexa device (Alexa skill)
	\item MongoDB document store (database)
\end{enumerate}

Foodo follows the state-of-the-art design decision to separate the corresponding code into separate repositories. The lambda function and the Alexa skill however share one repository as recommended by the Amazon Development Documentation. 

The algorithm is furthermore integrated into the backend as a git submodule to support interoperability and loosely coupling which allows to plug-in different substitution algorithms in the future. The components frontend, backend, lambda function and Alexa skill furthermore communicate through HTTP or related protocols. 

In conclusion, the Foodo application can be described as a microservice-oriented application that follows the client-server model. The REST backend and the lambda function can be considered as servers for the Alexa skill and frontend which act as clients. In addition, the backend also serves the lambda function in order to query the database. The backend abstracts the database layer from all other components to support separation of concerns and to reduce code redundancy.

\subsection*{Infrastructure}
As for the infrastructure, the Foodo software system is hosted on the \gls{aws} cloud and can therefore be described as a cloud-native application. This design decision allows us to scale, load-balance, and secure the application based on state-of-the-art standards set by big cloud providers. Furthermore, by using AWS, we also profit from low to zero costs through the pay-as-you-go pricing model. Following AWS services are utilized for the different software components:

\begin{enumerate}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item Frontend is hosted as a static webpage on a S3 bucket
	\item Frontend is distributed with HTTPS support via Cloudfront
	\item Backend is hosted on a Elastic Beanstalk Container
	\item Lambda function is hosted on AWS lambda
	\item Database is hosted on mLab.com (subsidiary of MongoDB Inc.)
	\item Alexa skill is distributed via the Amazon Alexa Appstore 
	\item Alexa skill is hosted on the Amazon Alexa Developer Console
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Code flow}
We incorporated HTTPS for our front- and backend to follow state-of-the-art security guidelines that are also mandatory (enforced by Amazon) for the account linking of Alexa skills. On top of HTTPS, the Foodo application uses \gls{rest} as a communication paradigm based on \gls{json}.

Authorization and authentication are essential parts of a distributed and secure microservice architecture and require a state-of-the-art protocol implementation. The Foodo software system implements the \gls{oauth2} framework (as defined in RFC 6749) to offer its users a sophisticated authorization and authentication flow, as described below.  

\subsection*{Authentication flow}
The oAuth2 framework is based on issuing tokens to give a user permission to access restricted parts of the application. Foodo incorporates three different grant types to provide an easy way for the user to login and fulfill all requirements of the Alexa account linking. 

The first grant type \textit{Resource Owner Password Credentials} handles the login and sign-up process in the React web app. At first, the user enters his username and password into a webform and submits them to the backend server. Once the backend successfully validated the credentials, it responds with a newly generated access token, which is then securely stored by the React web app.

The second grant type \textit{Authorization Code} is required to link the Foodo user profile to the Amazon account of the Alexa user. This procedure has to be done only once before the initial start of the Alexa skill. After the user has installed the Foodo skill through the Alexa App (Amazon skill store), the user gets prompted to link the Foodo profile to the Alexa account. On click on the linking button, the user gets redirected to the Foodo web app displaying an authorization form. The React app passes the request to the Foodo backend which validates the access token and responds with an authorization code. Once the React web app has received this code, the user gets redirected to a predefined Amazon URL. Thereafter, an Amazon service sends an access token request to the backend containing the authorization code. As soon as the backend confirms the validity of the authorization code, it sends an access token in response, which will be stored by Amazon Alexa for further use. 

The last grant type \textit{Refresh Token} provides a convenient way to renew an expired access token. All issued access tokens contain the following information:
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em
	\item access-token: string that represents the access token
	\item access-token-expires-in: datetime after which the access token is invalid
	\item refresh-token: string that represents the refresh token
	\item refresh-token-expires-in: datetime after which the refresh token is invalid
\end{itemize}


When a request attempts to access a protected resource with an expired access token, the backend denies this access. The React web app includes an automatic code flow to identify a failed attempt through the specified error code and requests a new access token using the locally stored refresh token. The backend validates the refresh token and issues a new access token.

\subsection*{Authorization flow}
Each request for a protected resource requires authorization. The oAuth2 server implementation for Node.js checks if the HTTP header of a request contains the Authorization property. This property has to include the token type (\textit{Bearer}) as well as the access token which was provided during the authentication process. For example: \vspace{-1.5em}
\begin{center}
	\texttt{Authorization: Bearer b0279b5a647d68241d0e9a3852bfc694a487b989}
\end{center}

\subsection*{Internationalization}
We used the third-party library \texttt{i18n} to utilize internationalization based on locales. The Foodo application currently supports English and German but could very easily be expanded to any language. \texttt{i18n} is used in the lambda function and frontend simultaneously. 

\subsection*{Environment handling}
All repositories utilize \texttt{.env} files to manage environment variables to enable test, development and production environments. We utilize these logics to enable logging, switching home paths and other environment based information. Furthermore, the \texttt{.env} files allow us to encapsulate sensible information like passwords or private keys from the code repositories.

\section{Frontend architecture}

The frontend of the Foodo software system is implemented as a web app that runs in the user’s browser. The JavaScript library \textit{React} was used to implement a state-of-the-art \gls{ui}. Furthermore, the following technologies have been used:

\begin{itemize}
		\itemsep-0.5em
	\item HTML5
	\item SCSS (CSS-Preprocessor)
	\item JavaScript and JSX
	\item Webpack 
	\item NPM
	\item Eslint
\end{itemize}

We used the package manager \gls{npm} to organize third party libraries and frameworks. We built our application on top of \texttt{create-react-app}, an official React skeleton application that comes with pre-configured \texttt{Webpack}, \texttt{Babel}, \texttt{Eslint} and \texttt{SCSS} support. To further configure the coding environment, we ejected out of \texttt{create-react-app}.

\subsection*{React web app}
React is not opinionated about folder structure and code structure but we followed a well adapted pattern of component-container abstraction. React uses components to isolate the frontend code into separate entities. With the component-container abstraction, following naming convention is used: 

Components are pure components without state and containers are stateful components that handle the application state. In addition, the frontend utilizes many of the latest React features like context (global state management), custom hooks (functional separation-of-concern pattern to share state or functionality between components) and the use of functional components instead of classes using the new hook API. 

This enabled us to build highly performant frontend code that shares API data across the application and manages user state efficiently while also providing a straightforward scalable and reusable component infrastructure. 

\subsection*{Design choices}
The Foodo frontend UI follows the design principles of Google’s \textit{Material Design}\footnote{Material Design - https://material.io} and is based on the design language of \textit{Ant Design}\footnote{Ant Design - https://ant.design}. This enables Foodo to have a consistent design and UI across all pages. It relies heavily on the SCSS features of extending css-classes and reusing css-values which allows to predefine design choices like font, coloring, padding, margin, box shadows and border boxes, and content alignment once for the whole application. This also enables to switch between design prototypes very quickly. The \texttt{\_variables.scss} file was used to store the global variables of the SCSS designs. 
\vspace{-2em}
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Ressourcen/img/code/scss.png}
		\vspace{-3em}
		\caption{Global styling in \texttt{\_variables.scss}}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Folder structure}
The frontend code is furthermore structured as follows:

\dirtree{%
.1 foodo-frontend/ .
.2 public .
.2 scripts .
.2 src .
.3 img .
.3 js .
.4 components .
.4 containers .
.4 hooks .
.4 provider .
.4 services .
.4 utilities .
.4 views .
.3 scss .
.4 includes .
}

As mentioned above, the React components are divided into stateful components (\texttt{container}) and pure functional components (\texttt{components}). An example for a pure component would be the \texttt{button} component that offers an abstraction layer for a predefined button with corresponding styling to reuse across the application. As you can derive from the code example (see figure \ref{fig:button}), the Foodo frontend utilizes latest JavaScript syntactic sugar notations like arrow functions and \gls{jsx}.

\vspace{-2em}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{Ressourcen/img/code/button.png}
		\vspace{-3em}
		\caption{Pure basic button component (\texttt{button.js})}
		\label{fig:button}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{App.js} container on the other hand, handles the application routing (based on \texttt{react-} \texttt{router-dom}), renders the \texttt{navbar} and the content of the application, while also rendering all context providers with the global state on mounting of the application. The app container won’t be used more than once within the application tree but it is used as a container for content and smaller containers to wrap functionality for the user. 

The \texttt{hooks} folder is used to abstract functionality with the new hook API. Those functions offer sharable functionality for the different components. For instance, we created the custom hook \texttt{useDeviceState.js} (see figure \ref{fig:hook})  to validate if the current device \texttt{isMobile}, a boolean based on \texttt{eventListeners} of the browser API that refreshes all dependent components if \texttt{isMobile} changes. Furthermore, hooks (in contrast to global state) reduce the risk of side-effects as different components inject the hook's state without sharing it application-wide. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{Ressourcen/img/code/hook.png}
	\vspace{-4em}
	\caption{Device state in custom hook (\texttt{useDeviceState.js})}
	\vspace{3em}
	\label{fig:hook}
\end{figure}
The \texttt{provider} folder comprises the context and context-providers. The context API is used to share global (API-)data across different components. For instance, the \texttt{RecipesProvider} (see figure \ref{fig:provider}) holds and shares the standard recipes with the full application scope.

As most of the context providers get initialised as children of the application container component, they have to be rendered only once on application startup. This enables Foodo to get the application state from the backend (e.g. all recipes, ingredients, user recipes) on initial rendering of the application. By that, the visible loading time for the user is reduced significantly. Moreover, as the application container only renders once, the context-provider will stay within the React \gls{dom} until the user closes the browser tab. This allows the Foodo frontend to retrieve the data only once during the user session which saves network data and further reduces lag times.

The \texttt{service} folder is used to abstract the HTTP functionality which is not part of the React library. All services utilize the third-party library \textit{axios} to implement the \gls{ajax} requests. 

The basic HTTP functionality (\texttt{GET}, \texttt{POST}, \texttt{PUT}, \texttt{DELETE}, header creation) is implemented in \texttt{foodo-api/httpService.js}. Building on top of it, \texttt{oAuthService.js} handles the oAuth2 authorization and authentication of the user. The actual REST endpoints get called by specific functions in the different subfolders e.g. \texttt{user/userService.js} offers the functions to login and register a user while \texttt{user/profile} \texttt{Service.js} offers AJAX calls to post and put profile information of a user. \vspace{6em}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.28]{Ressourcen/img/code/context.png}
	\vspace{-4em}
	\caption{Global state shared by context-provider (\texttt{RecipeProvider.js})}
	\label{fig:provider}
	\vspace{3em}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{utilities} folder offers a variety of utility classes and helper functions that do not fit in any of the other folders. The internationalizion folder for example holds the \texttt{i18n} implementation to support global string management as a lightweight language module. The \texttt{localStorage} of the browser API is also abstracted as helper functions in the utility folder and used to store the user token, redirect urls, user locale and other information into the persistent session and local storage. 
\clearpage

\section{Lambda function architecture} \label{lambda}

The lambda function provides Alexa intent handlers using Node.js and the \texttt{ask-sdk} (Software Development Kit for Alexa skill development).The folder structure of the repository incorporates the Alexa skill definition (\texttt{skill.json} and \texttt{/models}), the lambda function (\texttt{/lambda/custom}) as well as utilities like the deployment pipeline (\texttt{.ask}) provided by the \gls{askcli}. The folder structure of the lambda function was designed as follows and is based on skeleton applications provided by the Alexa GitHub\footnote{Alexa Github - https://github.com/alexa} repository: \vspace{1em}

\dirtree{%
.1 lambda/custom .
.2 intentHandlers .
.2 internationalization .
.2 services .
.3 foodo-api .
.2 .env .
.2 index.js .
.2 package.json .
}

The lambda function starts on usage of the Alexa skill through an Alexa device or the Alexa Developer Console and runs the \texttt{index.js} script. Within \texttt{index.js} the \texttt{ask-sdk} skill builder utility is called to load the intent handlers from the corresponding folder and build the Alexa skill. The \texttt{internationalization} folder is used as a middleware (interceptor) and builds on the same \texttt{i18n} package used in the frontend. 

Each intent handler provides two functions. \texttt{canHandle} defines a boolean return value if the intent handler can process the intent from the Alexa skill that is currently activated by the user and \texttt{handle} is used to implement the actual functionality of the lambda function. For instance, the \texttt{RecipeHandler} is responsible for \texttt{RecipeIntents} and when called, \texttt{handle} will output a list of recipes that Foodo offers to the user. 

The \texttt{CookingHandler} can handle the \texttt{CookingIntent} and offers a complex dialogue to navigate the user through the cooking process. The \texttt{CookingHandler} therefore utilizes \texttt{requestEnvelope} variables that can be filled with values by the user and are passed to the lambda function by the Alexa device. The current dialogue step gets identified by the intent handler by checking which variables have been filled already. 

At first the handler checks if the recipe variable has been filled by the user. If not, we output a prompt to the user to ask what he wants to cook. If the recipe value is filled already, we move on and make an AJAX call to the backend to retrieve the user recipe of the currently authorized user by the recipe name. We further prompt if the user wants to substitute the worst ingredient. If the user replies with \textit{yes}, Alexa will insert the value yes into the requestEnvelope \texttt{yesNoValue} and we can further retrieve possible substitutes for the user recipe and prompt the different substitution options to the user. If the user answers with a valid option (one, two, or three as defined in the dialogue model), we use the named index to identify the selected substitute and call the backend again to alter the user recipe. 

This step is needed as it is currently not supported in Alexa intents to dynamically offer \texttt{requestEnvelope} values for a variable that the user can select. As a workaround, the user can pick indices (hard coded \texttt{requestEnvelope} values 1, 2, 3) that refer to dynamic values of the substitute names that we output to the user through made AJAX calls. Finally, we inform the user about the change and terminate the interaction. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{Ressourcen/img/alexa-flow}
	\caption{Example of Foodo Alexa skill flow}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The different intent handlers define the possible user interactions and facilitate to split different features into separate functions. The possible commands for the user to trigger the intents are defined in the model folder. Here, each intent is defined in all supported languages (German and English) to allow internationalization. The HTTP functionality is implemented within the \texttt{services/foodo-api} folder and follows the same design decisions as the frontend services. Again, \texttt{axios} is used as a third-party package to implement the requests. 

\section{Backend Architecture}

The backend of Foodo provides a REST API using the Node.js web application framework Express. Built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime, Node.js facilitates building lightweight and scalable network applications, as it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Express creates a thin layer of basic web application features on top of Node.js which can be extended by middleware modules. The abstraction of complex HTTP methods, extending the API by middleware modules and the lightweight architecture significantly reduce the overhead of building a robust and flexible REST API.

\vspace{-1em}
\subsection*{Code structure}
The folder structure is designed as follows:
\vspace{1em}
\dirtree{%
	.1 foodo-backend .
	.2 index.js .
	.2 src .
	.3 controllers .
	.3 models .
	.3 routes .
	.3 logger.js .
	.3 middlewares.js .
	.3 oauth.js .
}
We utilize the third-party package mongoose to organize and access the MongoDB database. The \texttt{model} folder is used to define the mongoose models that are used to structure data models based on a simple and straightforward JSON object. The \texttt{recipe.js} model for instance defines a schema with the following attributes:

\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=json,firstnumber=1,caption={Example of recipe "Lasagne"},captionpos=b]
{
	"_id": {
		"$oid": "5d1f7a5a17a0f81bea0cc696"
	},
	"directions": [],
	"imgUrl": "...",
	"ingredients": [
		{
			"ingredient": {
				"$oid": "5d0934799a8ab5830d9edb25"
			},
			"amount": 3
		}, ...
	],
	"name": "Lasagne",
	"preparationTime": 60,
	"meal": "Dinner",
	"difficulty": "Medium",
	"servings": []
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}

Thereby, the backend enforces a basic structure that every standard recipe has to follow. Every standard recipe holds a \texttt{name}, a \texttt{preparation time}, a \texttt{meal} definition, a \texttt{difficulty}, an image URL and an array of ingredients and some further attributes. The \texttt{ingredients array} further encapsulates the two attributes \texttt{amount} and \texttt{ingredient}. \texttt{ingredient} is implemented as a foreign key \texttt{\_id} which points to a ingredient of the ingredient schema. Those foreign keys can further be populated on REST request. This allows the backend to specify precise response values for the different REST routes.  As a conclusion, mongoose allows to design relationships between data objects and we utilized this to implement the food taxonomy (see section \ref{database}).

The \texttt{controllers} folder is used to implement the REST endpoints that are defined in the \texttt{routes} folder. Routes define the structure of the express REST API (how) whereas the controllers implement the actual functionality (what) of the different endpoints. We used the state-of-the-art naming convention of a REST api. The backend offers the following REST routes and HTTP functions (Endpoints marked with \lockicon\footnote{Icon made by Freepik www.flaticon.com licensed by CC 3.0 BY} require a valid access token to be sent within the request).

\input{endpoints}

The different endpoints can be accessed by the lambda function and the frontend. The subscription route further gets called by PayPal webhooks and allows the backend to verify user subscriptions. All endpoints operate in the same way, retrieving the request data out of the request object, operating on the MongoDB database through mongoose and sending a response back to the client. The Express middleware handles the user authentication via the oAuth2 flow and passes the user object to all the restricted API endpoints fencing the actual REST endpoints from the authorization layer. 
\clearpage

\subsection*{Utilities}
The backend implements some utilities besides the express application. The \texttt{script} folder in the root folder contains utility scripts. The \texttt{data-import.js} script was used to import and convert the initial dataset that we received for the Foodo project into our data schema. The \texttt{internationalization.js} script was used to translate the ingredients names of the initial ingredient data to english to support internationalization. We utilized the Google Cloud API for that matter. The file \texttt{src/logger.js} implements a sophisticated logger based on the third-party package \texttt{winston} which allowed us to define log levels both for localhost and for the production system to ease debugging and error handling. 

\section{Algorithm} \label{algorithm}
The endpoint \texttt{/recipes/substitutes/} is used during the substitution process and calls the substitution algorithm (git submodule). The substitution algorithm searches for substitutes to improve the given recipe according to the user's preferences. The user's preferences consist of:
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item a nutrition goal ("Eating healthy" or "Reducing healthily weight"),
	\item a lifestyle ("Low carb", "Vegetarian", "Vegan" or "None"),
	\item dislikes (list of disliked ingredients or "None"), and
	\item allergies ("Gluten", "Lactose", "Fructose" or "None").
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{1em}

For determining how healthy an ingredient is, the algorithm relies on the NutriScore \autocite{julia_nutri-score_2017}. This score reaches from 'A' (healthy) to 'E' (unhealthy) and was developed by nutrition scientists for rating the healthiness of dishes. It is mandatory to print it on products sold in France. 

If the user's goal is "Reducing healthily weight", the algorithm calculates the energy density of ingredients, as a low energy density of the nutrition is found to be linked to weight reduction \autocite{ello-martin_influence_2005}. Moreover, the algorithm relies on a food taxonomy to find potential substitutes. 

Our food taxonomy consists of twelve categories, namely: 'Dairy Product',  'Oils, fats and shortenings', 'Meat and poultry',    'Fish and seafood', 'Vegetables', 'Fruits', 'Breads, cereals and grains', 'Soups (canned and diluted)', 'Desserts and sweets', 'Nuts and seeds', 'Beverages' and 'Spices'. The algorithm always searches for substitutes within the same food category of the ingredient to be substituted.
\clearpage

\subsection*{Steps of the algorithm}
The algorithm consists of two major steps. In the first step the algorithm iterates through the recipe's ingredients and identifies bad ingredients. An ingredient is bad if it fulfills at least one of the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item the ingredient's NutriScore is C or worse,
	\item it has a high energy density and the user's nutrition goal is "Reducing healthily weight",
	\item it is not suitable for the user's lifestyle,
	\item it is contained in the user's set of dislikes, or
	\item it triggers one of the user's allergies.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip \bigskip
              
After having identified the bad ingredients the algorithm tries to find suitable substitutes within the same ingredient category. A potential substitute is suitable if it fulfills the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemsep-0.5em 
	\item  the substitute's NutriScore is lower than the bad ingredient's one or if the bad ingredient's one is already A or B then A or B is sufficient for the substitute's NutriScore,
	\item the substitute is not in conflict with the user's nutrition goal
	\item it is suitable for the user's lifestyle
	\item it does not trigger the user's allergies, and
	\item it is not contained in the user's set of dislikes, except for the case that there are not any other potential substitutes available which fulfill all of the preceding requirements and are not dislikes of the user.
\end{itemize}
When the algorithm has identified a list of suitable substitutes for each of the bad ingredients, it sorts these lists ascendingly based on the NutriScore, so that the healthiest substitute is in the first place. The results, containing the ranked substitutes per bad ingredient, are returned to the calling endpoint.

Additionally, the algorithm offers a function for the Alexa skill which identifies the worst ingredient of a recipe based on the NutriScore and returns the three best substitutes for it in an ordered list. 
\clearpage
\section{Database} \label{database}
The MongoDB document store is abstracted by the backend and organised by the mongoose package. Following schemas have been designed through the backend and organize the Foodo data layer: 

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Ressourcen/img/db}
		\caption{Database schema of Foodo}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Data model relationships}
The recipe describes a basic recipe that holds a set of ingredients. Each ingredient has a category and a set of allergies (gluten, lactose, fructose) and lifestyles (vegan, vegetarian, none, or low carbohydrates). The user model is connected to the authorization flow data objects client, token, and code. Tokens are used to handle the authorization of the user, whereas clients define the different clients (frontend and lambda function) that the user can use to authenticate. The code schema is used to offer authorization codes for the user to authorize clients (Alexa) to act in behalf of the user. The user also holds subscriptions. We defined a simple access level hierarchy (admin, subscribed, free) that is implemented via the subscription model. In addition, the user holds profile information about his lifestyle, goal (eat healthy, reduce weight), allergies and dislikes (ingredients). The user is also linked to its personalized recipes that contain a reference to the original standard recipe and a new set of current ingredients and a list of blocked substitutes that the user does not wanted to change. The cooking schema is used as a state management for the Alexa cooking intent. If the user has indicated within the dialogue flow that he wants to substitute, the possible substitutes for the current recipe and user are stored in the cooking object and later accessed if the user decides which substitute he wants to use in the substitution process (see section \ref{lambda}).

\vspace{-1em}
	\begin{itemize} 
		\itemsep-0.5em 
		\item Dairy products
		\item Oils, fats and shortenings	
		\item Meat and poultry	
		\item Fish and seafood
		\item Vegetables	
		\item Fruits	
		\item Breads, cereals and grains	
		\item Soups (canned and diluted)	
		\item Desserts and sweets	
		\item Nuts and seeds	
		\item Beverages
		\item Spices
	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Food taxonomy}
One important task of implementing the Foodo software system was designing a food taxonomy that would allow to implement a sophisticated substitution algorithm. From our perspective, personalization was one key aspect that the food taxonomy had to offer to the Foodo user. Therefore, as mentioned above, the user object holds attributes for disliked ingredients, allergies, a lifestyle and a personal goal . 

Furthermore, through the cooking process (frontend cooking page or Alexa cooking intent), the selected standard recipe is used as a starting point for the current user's personalized recipe (\texttt{personalized recipe} mongoose model). Once the user has a personalized user recipe for a corresponding standard recipe, the user recipe will be used instead. 

The user recipe holds further attributes for personalization. Every user recipe holds an array to block possible substitutes. If the user denies a substitute, the Foodo system will remember this decision. To offer fitting and related substitutes for each ingredient (see section \ref{algorithm}) each ingredient also holds information about supported lifestyles, allergies, NutriScore information and a category (see figure \ref{categories}). The definition of categories allows the substitution algorithm to filter for fitting ingredients. 

Finally, all past substitutions are saved in the user's personalized recipe and logged in the \texttt{substitution} mongoose model. This would allow the Foodo software system to learn and analyze most utilized substitutes for each recipe and ingredient and implement a substitution recommender system or even machine learning based substitution mechanisms. 

\subsection*{Test and demo data}
The Foodo data records are based on ingredients data that we received as a starting point. The transfer process included internationalization, elimination of redundant and messy data entries, converting amount information to standardized units (gram and milliliter), and transferring the data records to the Foodo \texttt{ingredient} mongoose model. 

Currently, the MongoDB document store contains 304 ingredients. After transferring the data to the Foodo database, we further needed to add information to each ingredient data entry. For that purpose, the Foodo frontend implements four features for administrators. For each ingredient, we used the \texttt{SetAllergies}, \texttt{SetCategory} and the \texttt{SetLifestyles} administrator pages of the Foodo frontend to add allergies, categories and lifestyle information. To support the data preparation process, we also utilized helper scripts. For instance, we were able to automatically set lactose and fructose allergies based on already set categories. We furthermore created 15 standard recipes for testing and demo purposes through the \texttt{CreateRecipe} administrator page.

\textit{Foodo - Your Loyal Companion on Your Way to a Healthier Lifestyle}
\end{center}

Foodo offers the user a collection of standard recipes. A subset of these standard recipes represents user's recipe stock, namely the dishes the user is used to cook regularly. The main goal of Foodo is to iteratively extend and to improve the healthiness of the user's recipe stock in a personal way. This is achieved by Foodo, as it offers the user healthy variations of the recipes of his recipe stock by enabling the user to substitute the recipes' ingredients with suggested healthy substitutes. Moreover, Foodo's collection of standard recipes offers the user the opportunity to extend his recipe stock by trying new recipes. 

As nutrition is very individual, Foodo is a personal companion and adjusts its suggestions to the characteristics of the user. The user can set personal preferences. These include his lifestyle, e.g. Vegetarian, Vegan or Low Carb, his nutrition goal, e.g. eating healthy, reducing weight or gaining muscles, his dislikes and his allergies, e.g. Gluten, Lactose or Fructose. After setting these personal preferences, Foodo takes them into consideration and finds the best personal suggestions for the user's recipe stock. If the user accepts a suggested substitution, the recipe gets updated and becomes part of his personal recipe stock. Moreover, the user can give feedback on the substitution after he has cooked the recipe which has been modified with the substitution. Foodo will remember his feedback and incorporate in it in its future suggestions. Like this, the suggestions get even more personalized over time

Foodo offers different channels to interact with the user. These are a webapp and an Alexa skill. The webapp offers detailed information on the available recipes, the user's recipe stock, his preferences, the recipes, their nutrition values and statistics on achieved improvements by using Foodo. This channel targets the sophisticated user and is additionally used for fulfilling administrative tasks like inserting the user's preferences. The Alexa skill focuses on the substitution process and on supporting the cooking activity. Therefore, it does not offer statistics or too detailed infromation, but it guides the user through the core functionalities in a supportive way. This channel targets the casual user and also allows the usage of Foodo while cooking, as only requires voice for the interaction and thus it does not interfere with the cooking activity.
